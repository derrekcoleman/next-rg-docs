npm i
# then
yarn install
```

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Extension

`src/lib/verifyUser.js` holds the logic for verifying users.
Currently, it has a custom ABI implementation that can be updated to make a subgraph call instead.

## Deploy on Vercel
